Significance: >-

  Maj. Gen. T. J. Jackson's decisive victory
  over a small Union force at Front Royal on 23 May 1862, forced
  the main Union Army at Strasburg under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P.
  Banks into abrupt retreat.  Jackson deceived Banks into believing
  that the CS army was in the main Valley near Harrisonburg;
  instead he had marched swiftly north to New Market and crossed
  Massanutten via New Market Gap to Luray.  The advance to Front
  Royal placed Jackson in position to move directly on Winchester
  in the rear of the Union army.  On 24 May, Banks retreated down
  the Valley Pike to Winchester, harassed by CS cavalry and
  artillery at Middletown and Newtown (Stephens City), setting the
  stage for the battle of First Winchester the following day.
  
  The action at Front Royal demonstrated Jackson's use of Valley
  topography and mobility to unite his own forces while dividing
  those of his enemies.  At a minimal cost, he forced the
  withdrawal of a large Union army by striking at its flank and
  threatening its rear.  The confusion engendered by Jackson's
  appearance at Front Royal and the hasty Union retreat from
  Strasburg to Winchester contributed materially to the defeat of
  Banks' army at First Winchester on 25 May.  Jackson used his
  cavalry to good advantage at Front Royal, to sever US
  communications east and west, and to strike the final blow at
  Cedarville.
  
  
Description of the Battle: >-
  
  Prelude: On 21 May 1862, the US army under Maj. Gen.
  Nathaniel P. Banks, numbering about 9,000 men, was concentrated
  in the vicinity of Strasburg with two companies of infantry at
  Buckton Depot.  Col. J. R. Kenly commanded 1,063 men and two guns
  at Front Royal.  CS cavalry under Col. Turner Ashby confronted
  Banks near Strasburg, but then withdrew to join the main army
  which crossed Massanutten Mountain via New Market Gap to reach
  Luray.
  
  On 22 May, Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's Army of the Valley
  (about 16,500 men) advanced along the muddy Luray Road to within
  ten miles of Front Royal.  Jackson's headquarters were at Cedar
  Point.  Colonel Thomas Munford's cavalry regiment was sent east
  to close off Manassas Gap and cut communication between Front
  Royal and Washington.
  
  Phase One.  CS Advance: On the morning of 23 May, the
  vanguard of Jackson's army reached Spangler's crossroads (present
  day Limeton).  Here the CS cavalry under colonels Ashby and
  Flournoy diverged west to cross the South Fork Shenandoah at
  McCoy's Ford.  The infantry continued to Asbury Chapel and right
  onto a cross road to reach Gooney Manor Road.  Following this
  road, they approached Front Royal from the south, bypassing
  Federal pickets stationed near the river on the Luray Road one
  mile south of the courthouse.  After minor skirmishing the
  Federals withdrew.
  
  Phase Two.  Deployment of Forces: Jackson's leading
  brigade, Taylor's, deployed on Prospect Hill and along the ridge
  to the east.  The 1st Maryland and Wheat's Louisiana battalion
  were thrown out in advance, entering the town and clearing it of
  US skirmishers.  Col. J. R. Kenly, in command of US forces,
  withdrew his force to Camp (Richards') Hill, supported by a
  section of artillery.  The US line extended in an arc from the
  South Fork to Happy Creek, defending the South Fork bridge. 
  Kenly's artillery opened fire and slowed the CS advance.  Kenly's
  headquarters were in the Vanoort House.
  
  Phase Three.  US Defense of Camp Hill: The Confederate
  infantry advanced through town, deploying into line of battle
  under an accurate artillery fire.  A CS flanking column moved to
  the east, crossing Happy Creek in an attempt to force US
  withdrawal without a frontal assault.  After a long delay because
  of the muddy roads, a battery of rifled artillery was deployed on
  or near Prospect Hill to counter the Union guns on Camp Hill.
  
  Phase Four.  Skirmish at Buckton Depot: In the meantime,
  after crossing the South Fork at McCoy's Ford, Ashby's and Lt.
  Col. Flournoy's (6VA) cavalry rode via Bell's Mill and Waterlick
  Station to reach the US outpost at Buckton Depot.  Ashby made a
  mounted assault, which cost him several of his best officers
  before the US defenders surrendered.  Ashby cut the telegraph
  lines, severing communication between the main US army at
  Strasburg and the detached force at Front Royal.  He then divided
  the cavalry, sending Flournoy's regiment east toward Riverton to
  threaten Kenly's rear.  Ashby remained at Buckton Depot astride
  the railroad to prevent reinforcements from being sent to Front
  Royal.
  
  Phase Five.  US Retreat: On discovering that Confederate
  cavalry was approaching from the west, Col. Kenly abandoned his
  position on Camp Hill, retreated across the South and North Fork
  bridges, and attempted to burn them.  He positioned part of his
  command at Guard Hill, while the Confederates ran forward to
  douse the flames, saving the bridges.  While CS infantry repaired
  the bridges for a crossing, Flournoy's cavalry arrived at
  Riverton and forded the river, pressing Kenly's forces closely. 
  As soon as the CS infantry crossed, the US position could be
  flanked by a column moving along the river.  Kenly chose to
  continue his withdrawal, his outmatched cavalry fighting a rear
  guard action against Flournoy's 6th Virginia Cavalry.
  
  Phase Six.  US Surrender: Kenly withdrew along the
  Winchester turnpike beyond Cedarville with Flournoy's cavalry in
  close pursuit.  General Jackson rode ahead with the cavalry, as
  CS infantry began to cross the rivers.  At the Thomas McKay
  House, one mile north of Cedarville, Kenly turned to make a
  stand, deploying on the heights on both sides of the pike. 
  Flournoy's cavalry swept around the US flanks, causing panic. 
  Kenly fell wounded, and the US defense collapsed.  More than 700
  US soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered.
  
Current Condition of the Battlefield: >-
  
  Many terrain features associated with this battle have been
  overwhelmed by the growth of the City of Front Royal.  At the
  time of the battle, Front Royal was a small village of several
  streets clustered around the courthouse.  Troops maneuvered among
  the buildings and on open ground, south, east, and north of the
  village, areas which have now been urbanized.  Loss of integrity
  is most obvious when attempting to understand maneuvers in and
  around Camp (Richardson's) Hill.  It is difficult to find a
  vantage point to understand the terrain advantage of the US
  position there.  Camp Hill itself, site of Kenly's defense, is
  densely residential (Warren Park subdivision).  Open ground east
  of Camp Hill and Happy Creek would enable some understanding of
  CS flanking maneuvers although access is restricted.
  
  The massive reshaping of Guard Hill, due to road-widening and
  quarrying, and heavy construction north to I-66 is an obvious
  loss.  The current ``gap'' in Guard Hill for US 340/522 is
  largely a modern cut.  Large industrial structures, including the
  DuPont Automotive plant, have been constructed in the vicinity of
  Cedarville on ground maneuvered over in the closing phase of the
  battle.
  
  In spite of these losses, several features, primarily
  architectural, remain by which the flow of the battle may be
  interpreted.  The hamlet of Spangler's Crossroads (Limeton) and
  the road to McCoy's Ford enable an understanding of CS cavalry
  movements, preparatory to the battle.  The roads from McCoy's
  Ford to Buckton Depot taken by the CS cavalry pass through a
  scenic rural countryside.  The site of Buckton Depot (and a depot
  building, vintage uncertain), the site of Ashby's skirmish, can
  be located.  Asbury Chapel marks where the CS infantry diverged
  from Luray Road to reach Gooney Manor Road.  Gooney Manor Road
  passes through a scenic landscape until near the entrance to
  Skyline Drive at Front Royal, where there is dense development.
  
  In the town of Front Royal, Prospect Hill Cemetery maintains open
  ground where the CS left flank first deployed and where artillery
  was positioned.  The cemetery offers a good vantage point for
  understanding the terrain and tactical movements.  Monuments to
  Mosby's men and to the Warren Rifles are in Prospect Hill
  Cemetery.  In a general sense, the Front Royal old town can be
  considered a supporting resource, although the district is not
  listed in the National Register.  The Warren Rifles museum
  interprets the role of Warren County residents in the Civil War. 
  A historic marker and a Confederate monument stand in front of
  the courthouse.  The estate of Rose Hill, a beautiful old home,
  is specifically mentioned in several battle accounts.
  
  The South and North Fork bridge sites can be located.  Riverside
  Farm (c. 1850) at Riverton preserves about 150 acres of open
  farmland and a segment of the original alignment of the Front
  Royal-Winchester turnpike.  (Stonewall Jackson is said to have
  slept on the porch here on the night after the battle.) The
  hamlet of Riverton dates primarily from the 1880s.  The old Guard
  House stands on the hill to the west of the new road cut.  The
  Robert and Jacob McKay houses (late 1700s) and the old store (c.
  1860) at Cedarville provide some sense of historic character in
  spite of encroaching residential development.  The Thomas McKay
  House where US forces surrendered stands one mile north of
  Cedarville (currently an antique store).  A large industrial
  building adjacent to the house degrades the setting.
  
Perception of Threats to Battlefield: >-
  
  In terms of terrain, battlefield ground within the city limits of
  Front Royal has been lost.  The Riverton Corporation controls
  access to Guard Hill along the river.  Heavy quarrying is
  occurring on the northern and eastern slopes of the hill and on
  land adjacent to the river.  Highway widening has increased the
  size of the Guard Hill gap and is reshaping the ground.  Plans
  being discussed to build a second span over the North Fork would
  further degrade this area of low integrity.  Riverside Farm is
  the last area of open farmland at Riverton.  The flood plain of
  the North Fork is currently agricultural land.  An I-66
  interchange has spurred commercial and industrial development
  north of Guard Hill on the road to Cedarville.  The area north of
  Cedarville and east of US 340 is an expanding industrial park,
  currently encroaching on the US surrender area.  Adjacent to this
  industrial park is an ``Inland Port'' complex centered on a
  railroad terminal.
