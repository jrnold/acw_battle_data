Significance: >-

  As part of his 1864 spring offensive, Lt.
  Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel to advance
  south along the Valley Pike to destroy the railroad at Staunton
  and then to move on the rail complex at Lynchburg.  Although
  outnumbered, Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, former senator and
  vice president of the US, was able to concentrate scattered CS
  forces to meet Sigel's army near New Market.  Sigel was
  decisively defeated on 15 May 1864, and the Valley remained in
  Confederate hands until Maj. Gen. David Hunter renewed the US
  offensive on 26 May.  The battle of New Market is noted for the
  participation of a battalion of VMI cadets, who distinguished
  themselves in combat beside veteran troops.
  
  
Description of the Battle: >-
  
  Phase One.  Cavalry Actions: On 14 May 1864, Union cavalry
  under Quinn (mainly 1st NY Cav Lincoln) advanced south on the
  Valley Pike from Mt. Jackson, driving CS cavalry (18VA) under
  Imboden across Meem's Bottom and beyond Rude's Hill, where
  defense stiffened.  Reinforced by a brigade of infantry under
  Moor, and Wynkoop's cavalry brigade, US forces again advanced
  with Imboden withdrawing to New Market.  CS cavalry, fighting
  dismounted supported Imboden and established a line south of New
  Market behind Shirley's Hill.  The CS line stretched thinly from
  Shirley's Hill to Smith Creek.  Federals continued to advance,
  launching two attacks about 2000 and 2200 hours, both of which
  were repulsed.  After dark, Imboden withdrew farther to the
  south, after successfully retarding Sigel's advance.
  
  Phase Two.  CS Advance: After midnight, Breckinridge
  brought most of his command north along the Valley Pike from near
  Lacey Spring.  By 0600 hours, 15 May, Breckinridge reached the
  Shenandoah County line.  He halted near here to reconnoiter and
  about 0800 hours sent his cavalry and artillery forward to harass
  the US force under Moor at New Market.  CS artillery unlimbered
  and fired from Shirley's Hill.  Moor established his line along
  the old River Road with artillery on Manor's Hill and in St.
  Matthews (currently the Lutheran) cemetery.  The rest of Sigel's
  infantry was spread out along the pike as far north as Edinburg. 
  Brig. Gen. Julius Stahel arrived about 0830 and ordered Moor to
  withdraw some of his troops to Bushong's Hill.  While
  Breckinridge waited on the rest of his infantry to reach the
  field, US guns at the cemetery and CS guns on Shirley's Hill
  exchanged fire.
  
  Phase Three.  US Deployment/ Initial CS Attacks: About
  1100 hours, Sigel arrived on the battlefield and established
  temporary headquarters at the Rice House.  After reviewing Moor's
  dispositions he ordered his line withdrawn to a stronger position
  on Bushong's Hill, stretching between a bend in the North Fork
  and Smith's Creek.  Sigel brought up 14 guns to support his
  position, leaving DuPont's battery at Rude's Hill awaiting
  orders.  He placed cavalry on his left flank between the Valley
  Pike and Smith's Creek.  Breckinridge deployed on both sides of
  the Pike and advanced his infantry in force, driving back US
  skirmishers.  Imboden crossed Smith's Creek with his cavalry and
  attempted to outflank Sigel by moving north along the east bank. 
  By 1230, Sigel had withdrawn entirely from the town of New
  Market.  The 18CT and 123OH resisted the CS advance on Manor's
  Hill before joining the main battle line at Bushong's.
  
  Phase Four.  Bushong's Hill: About 1400 hours,
  Breckinridge launched an all-out assault against the US position
  on Bushong's Hill, using the 26VA, 30VA, 51VA, and 62VA.  The
  62nd Virginia suffered more than 50 percent casualties.  When the
  CS attack stalled under heavy small arms and artillery fire, the
  VMI battalion was ordered to fill the gap in the line near the
  Bushong House.  About 1445 hours, the US cavalry under Stahel
  attacked up the Valley Pike, riding into massed artillery which
  Breckinridge had shifted east from Shirley's Hill.  Stahel was
  repulsed with heavy casualties.  About 1500 hours, Sigel directed
  a confused counterattack, which was soon repulsed.  CS
  sharpshooters began picking off Union gunners on Bushong's Hill
  north of the farm, and Sigel ordered the batteries withdrawn. 
  When the artillery fire slackened, Breckinridge ordered a general
  advance and swept the Union line off Bushong's Hill.  In this
  assault, the VMI cadets captured a gun and many men of the 34MA. 
  To the east near the Valley Pike, elements of the 34MA and 54PA
  continued to resist, covering the Union retreat.  These regiments
  were eventually driven back, and the Union forces began a general
  retreat.
  
  Phase Five.  Rear Guard Actions: On his own initiative,
  Capt. Henry DuPont (US) brought up his battery to cover the
  retreat.  He unlimbered first near the Harshburger House, then
  withdrew his pieces rearward en echelon as the Confederates
  advanced.  Sigel fell back to his supports at the Cedar Grove
  Dunker Church and cemetery and organized a holding action, while
  his confused troops reorganized.  DuPont's artillery continued to
  slow the pursuit.  About 1630 hours, Breckinridge ordered a halt
  to regroup confronting the US line at Cedar Grove Church. 
  Imboden's cavalry returned from their fruitless effort to get in
  rear of Sigel's army to burn the Meem's Bottom Bridge across the
  North Fork (the creeks were swollen with rainfall).  An artillery
  duel continued until about 1700 hours.  Breckinridge was unable
  to organize another attack and, by 1900 hours, the Union army
  escaped across the North Fork and burned the bridge.  Sigel
  retreated down the Valley Pike rapidly, leaving his badly wounded
  at Mt. Jackson.  He arrived at Strasburg on the following day.
  
  
Current Condition of the Battlefield: >-
    
  The Virginia Military Institute owns battlefield land and
  operates a museum and visitor center.  New Market is one of two
  Valley battlefields that currently has facilities for visitors,
  the other being Cedar Creek.
  
  The New Market Battlefield Historical Park was established by VMI
  in 1967.  The Hall of Valor was constructed on the battlefield
  and opened in 1970.  The park contains about 280 acres: 24 acres
  of Shirley's Hill (recently acquired), about 40 acres east of I-
  81 around the Pennsylvania monument, and about 215 acres at the
  Hall of Valor parcel adjacent to the steep bluffs overlooking the
  North Fork Shenandoah River.  The park protects and preserves
  about ten percent of the core area of the New Market battlefield,
  but this includes several areas of the most severe infantry
  fighting.  The cavalry field, east of US 11 to Smith's Creek,
  remains farmland.  The village of New Market is listed in the
  National Register as a historic district.
  
  In spite a degree of the protection afforded by the battlefield
  park, the field survey integrity of the battlefield was rated
  low, due to the fragmented nature of the park and the prominent
  positioning of I-81, which is the most obtrusive feature.  I-81
  bisects the battlefield and battlefield park, and interchange 67
  of I-81 empties at the base of Manor's and Shirley's Hill.  The
  park is limited in its ability to interpret its separate parcels
  at Shirley's Hill, Bushong's Hill, and at the Pennsylvania
  monument.
  
  Two monuments were erected by veterans on the New Market
  battlefield and these are contained within the VMI battlefield
  park.  The Missouri (Woodson) monument near the Bushong House
  commemorates the role of Co. A, 1st Missouri cavalry that fought
  in the battle.  The second monument commemorates the role of the
  54th Regiment Pennsylvania infantry, located directly east of
  Bushong's Hill but separated from the main park by I-81.
  
  North on US 11 between New Market and the Pennsylvania Monument
  parcel there is light commercial and residential development,
  although this strip development is less dense than that south of
  town.  New construction has occurred on Manor's Hill on ground
  associated with the opening phases of the battle along the access
  road to the battlefield park (rte. 619) north of rte. 211.  This
  includes a large Day's Inn Motel and the New Market Battlefield
  Military Museum.  The exhibits of the Military Museum cover all
  American wars with special emphasis on the Civil War.  Monuments
  on the grounds were erected by the museum.
  
  The vicinity of Rude's Hill, Meem's Bottom, Mt. Airy, and the
  Cedar Grove Church is prime agricultural land that preserves the
  rural-historic integrity of this area.  Meem's Bottom and Rude's
  Hill were the scene of many armed encounters during the war
  because these features formed a ``choke point'' on the Valley
  Turnpike.  Confederate cavalry defended the North Fork Shenandoah
  River crossing and used Rude's Hill as an observation post.  The
  well preserved estate, Mt. Airy, served as a way station for
  Confederate staff officers and partisans, including Henry Kyd
  Douglas and Harry Gilmor.  Although not included directly in the
  battlefield study area, Meem's Bottom and Mt. Airy should be
  considered supporting resources.
  
Perception of Threats to Battlefield: >-
  
  The battlefield park is divided into at least four separate
  parcels.  The I-81 interchange has spawned a commercial strip
  that physically and visually separates the northern and southern
  portions of the main field of action.  The interstate itself
  divides the battlefield east and west.  The view from Shirley's
  Hill to the Lutheran (St. Matthews) Cemetery looks directly over
  a commercial strip and the large signs that are typical along
  interstates.  A large motel complex has been constructed between
  St. Matthews Cemetery and the interstate highway.  Two parcels of
  land at the base of Shirley's Hill along rte. 211 (about 5 acres)
  are zoned commercial.  New construction at these sites would
  further degrade the important view from Shirley's Hill.  New
  residential construction north of town along US 11 in the
  vicinity of the Pennsylvania momument has continued the process
  of fragmentation.
