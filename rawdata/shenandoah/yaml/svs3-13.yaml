Significance: >-

  Lt. Gen. Jubal Early was ``outgeneraled'' by
  Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan at Fisher's Hill.  Although the
  casualty figures were not high, this battle was a masterpiece of
  maneuver and surprise.  Sheridan's flanking attack brought
  Crook's corps to the left rear of Early's position on Fisher's
  Hill and threw the CS army into a panic.  Confederate defeat at
  Fisher's Hill (on the heels of defeat at Opequon) opened the
  Shenandoah Valley to a US advance that reached beyond Staunton. 
  When Sheridan withdrew during the first part of October, his army
  systematically burned mills, barns, crops, and forage, and ran
  off livestock.  By implementing this strategy of ``total
  warfare,'' Sheridan felt that he accomplished the primary
  objective of his campaign--to deprive the Confederacy of the
  agricultural abundance of the Valley.

Description of the Battle: >-

  Phase One.  CS Dispositions (19-20 September): After its
  crushing defeat at Winchester on 19 September 1864, the CS army
  withdrew to Fisher's Hill.  The US army pursued as far as Hupp's
  Hill on 20 September and massed near Strasburg.  The Confederate
  position at Fisher's Hill was a strong one, particularly at the
  center and on the right flank.  Wharton's division, on the
  Confederate right flank, entrenched along the high bluff
  overlooking Miller's bottom extended to the left to cover the
  Valley Pike (old alignment).  Gordon's division deployed from the
  Valley Pike across Manassas Gap Railroad to near the Middle Road
  above the hamlet of Fisher's Hill.  Pegram's division (formerly
  Ramseur's) was to Gordon's left, and Ramseur's division (formerly
  Rodes's) extended the line west to a high hill south of Tumbling
  Run South Fork (referred to a ``Ramseur's Hill'' in this report).
  
  The CS cavalry under Lomax extended the main line northwest to
  and beyond the Back Road.  Lomax's position was held with little
  more than a skirmish line.
  
  To mask these deployments, Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early placed a
  strong skirmish line on the hills north of Tumbling Run (Quarry
  Hill, Flint Hill, School House Hill).  General Early had his
  headquarters at the Widow Funkhouser house on the Valley Pike. 
  Confederate signal stations on Massanutten (Signal Knob) and
  Round Hill offered wide-ranging views of any Union moves against
  this line.  Early's artillery commanded all approaches along the
  pike, the railroad, and the Middle Road.  The advanced CS
  positions north of Tumbling Run were not supported by artillery. 
  A brigade of CS cavalry and a battery of horse artillery were
  placed on Sandy Hook east of the North Fork Shenandoah.
  
  Phase Two.  US Advance (21 September): About noon, 21
  September, Sheridan advanced his army south and west from
  Strasburg, massing the bulk of the VI Corps in a horseshoe
  opposite the CS right center on the plateau north of Flint Hill,
  its left at the Manassas Gap railroad.  The XIX Corps, weakened
  from the battle of Opequon, was placed on the US left east of the
  railroad with a skirmish line extending back through Strasburg to
  cover the fords over the Shenandoah North Fork and the road to
  Front Royal.  The line of these two corps was entrenched. 
  Crook's corps (nominally the Army of West Virginia) was held in
  reserve and out of sight of Signal Knob ``in the timber near
  Strasburg.'' Wright (VI Corps) established his headquarters in
  the Amos Stickley House (near the intersection of rte. 757 and I-
  81). Averell's cavalry division covered the Back Road.  The rest
  of Sheridan's cavalry was sent via Buckton Ford and Front Royal
  to advance up the Luray (Page) Valley.  Sheridan established
  headquarters at the George Hupp House just north of Strasburg.
  
  Phase Three.  Capture of Flint Hill (21 September): As US
  soldiers entrenched their new position, skirmishing heated up. 
  Sheridan and Wright surveyed the land but could see little of the
  main CS line because of two intervening hills, called ``Flint
  Hill.'' These hills were defended by a reinforced skirmish line
  barricaded behind ``hog'' or ``bull pens'' (U-shaped barricades
  made of fence rails that sheltered three men).  Sheridan ordered
  Wright to take the hills so that he would have an ``unobstructed
  view.'' Two regiments (126OH and 139PA) advanced but were thrown
  back.  Reinforced by a third regiment, they tried again without
  success.  The First Brigade/Second Division (five New York and
  Pennsylvania regiments) was brought into battle line and swept
  forward under command of Col. J. M. Warner (formerly commander of
  the Vermont brigade).  The hills fell quickly.  General Wright
  described this movement as ``of the greatest importance to the
  operations of the next day, as it gave us a view of the enemy's
  line and afforded excellent positions for artillery, of which we
  availed ourselves in the more important struggle of the 22nd.''
  Warner's men threw up rifle pits and bivouacked on the hills
  within rifle-musket range of the main CS line south of Tumbling
  Run.
  
  Phase Four.  US Battle Line Advanced (21-22 September):
  During the night, Sheridan extended his line westward with
  Ricketts division on the far right, Getty next, and Wheaton
  connecting with the XIX Corps at the railroad.  After sunrise,
  Crook's corps was brought forward, following ravines and staying
  in timber to be out of sight of the CS signal stations.  Shortly
  before noon, Ricketts division (VI Corps) moved to possess the
  heights overlooking the North Fork of Tumbling Run, while
  Averell's cavalry division advanced on the Back Road to establish
  a connection with Ricketts's right flank.  Keifer's brigade
  assaulted and carried the two hills south of the run (School
  House Ridge), driving CS skirmishers back on their main line. 
  Union skirmishers were pushed to within range of the CS works and
  began laying down a steady fire.  Ricketts formed his division
  behind the crest of the hills and awaited Crook's attack.
       In the meantime, about 1215 hours, Emory (XIX Corps) rushed
  Quarry Hill on the left with a brigade and seized the CS rifle-
  pits there.  His men immediately reversed the entrenchments,
  giving the Union army an unbroken line of rifle pits, extending
  from Quarry Hill across Flint Hill, confronting the main CS line
  on Fisher's Hill at a range of about 500 yards; skirmishing
  erupted along the line.  US batteries were brought up, and an
  artillery duel erupted in the vicinity of the village of Fisher's
  Hill.  Skirmishing continued until about 1600 hours.
  
  Phase Five.  Crook's Flank Attack (22 September): During
  the morning Gen. George Crook moved his two divisions (about
  5,000 men) to the base of Little North Mountain beyond St.
  Stephens Church, unseen by the Confederate signal station on
  Massanutten Mountain.  About 1400 hours, Sheridan directed him to
  commence a flanking movement along the shoulder of the mountain. 
  Crook formed his corps in two parallel columns and marched south
  until more than half of the command was beyond the Confederate
  left flank, which was held by Lomax's cavalry division.  Crook
  encountered only scattered fire from a few surprised pickets.
  
  About 1600 hours, Crook ordered his columns to face left and
  to charge.  The soldiers charged down the side of the mountain,
  shouting at the tops of their lungs.  The CS cavalry took to
  their horses and scattered.  In their rush down the hill, Crook's
  divisions lost all order; a mass of men funneled through the
  ravine of the Middle Fork of Tumbling Run past the Barbe House
  and closed on the Confederate infantry on ``Ramseur's Hill.'' A
  second mass funneled to the right along an old road that
  penetrated to the rear of the Confederate positions.  Grimes's
  brigade of North Carolinians held out against Crook's onslaught
  until Ricketts ordered his division forward.  Hearing, more than
  seeing, that they were flanked, CS defenders along the remainder
  of the line began abandoning their entrenchments.  Battle's CS
  brigade was sent to the left to confront Crook but was
  misdirected into a ravine and missed the fighting altogether. 
  Sheridan advanced his other divisions, the men attacking
  generally up the ravines.  Early's army was soon in full flight,
  abandoning equipment and 14 artillery pieces that could not be
  extricated from the works.
  
  Phase Six.  Rear Guard Action at Prospect Hill (22
  September): The CS army was a shambles but attempted to
  collect itself at the base of Round Hill on the Valley Pike. 
  Generals Gordon, Ramseur, and Pegram and staff officers
  established a rear guard of artillery and infantry at Prospect
  Hill and held off the disorganized Union pursuit.  During this
  action, Col. Alexander ``Sandie'' Pendleton, Stonewall Jackson's
  favorite staff officer, was wounded; he died the following day in
  Woodstock.  The CS army retreated to Narrow Passage, and the
  wagon train went on to Mt. Jackson.  Darkness and confusion among
  the Union victors prevented effective pursuit.
  
  During the fighting at Fisher's Hill, a CS cavalry division
  turned back the Union cavalry at Milford (present day Overall) in
  the Luray Valley, preventing an attempt to gain Early's rear by
  crossing the gap to New Market.  Sheridan remarked that if his
  cavalry had been successful, he could have captured Early's army.
  
  
  Current Condition of the Battlefield
  
  The excellent state of preservation and the existing rural
  character make the study of this battlefield pleasant as well as
  informative.  The battlefield can be interpreted mostly from
  public roads using about four vantage points, although the best-
  preserved Confederate entrenchments are on private property.  The
  hamlet of Fisher's Hill retains a historic appearance that
  includes an old mill (Keller's Mill) and other structures of
  Civil War vintage.  Rte. 601 from rte. 623 (Back Road) to US 11
  (Valley Pike) is a pristine rural landscape, except for a short
  stretch of trailers and a few modern houses west of but out of
  sight of ``Ramseur's Hill.'' I-81 is conducted over rte. 623 with
  no interchange and is not intrusive at ground level but becomes
  intrusive if one climbs the hills adjacent to it. 
  
  In 1990, the Association for Preservation of Civil War Sites
  (APCWS) acquired about 195 acres of land west of and adjacent to
  I-81 and north and south of rte. 601.  (The parcel of land south
  of rte. 601 is referred to as ``Ramseur's Hill'' in this report.)
  This was where the Confederate infantry met Crook's flank attack
  from the west and the assault of Ricketts' division from the
  north.  The parcel of APCWS land north of rte. 601 was the scene
  of preparatory skirmishing and a staging area for Ricketts'
  division.  Access to Ramseur's Hill provides an important vantage
  point for understanding and interpreting the battle.  Traces of
  Confederate entrenchments remain on the hill.  This area,
  although critically important in understanding the action, is
  visually degraded by I-81.
  
  A vantage point slightly north of the intersection of rtes.
  639 and 757 allows interpretation of opening phases of the battle
  and offers views of Flint Hill (actually two hills, separated by
  rte. 757) assaulted on 21 September.  The Emanuel Evangelical
  Church above the hamlet of Fisher's Hill offers a sweeping
  panorama of the CS positions south of Tumbling Run. 
  
  Many historic structures, including the Eastep and Barbe
  houses, a brick house (S. Funkhouser house) at the base of
  Ramseur's Hill, Keller's Mill, Stickley's Mill, and the Miller
  House are along rte. 601 in Tumbling Run valley.  The Widow
  Funkhouser House site, Early's headquarters, is on US 11 (vintage
  of current house was not determined).  Stone fences remain near
  the shell of the Jacob Funk house and barn, built by one of the
  county's first residents in the mid-1700s.
  
  Sections of the fieldworks on Fisher's Hill are extant with
  some segments in a good state of preservation.  Portions were
  bulldozed years ago where the entrenchments extended across
  pastureland, although in some cases shallow traces remain.  Works
  overlooking the old bed of the Valley Pike are in good condition.
  
  The line of entrenchments should be professionally surveyed. 
  Near the intersection of rtes. 11 and 601 the abutments of the
  old stone Valley Pike bridge remain. The old road trace climbs
  the face of the hill and in places is supported by stone
  retaining walls.
  
  Perception of Threats to Battlefield
  
  New construction activity in the area has been slight. 
  Several local landowners have erected modern houses for
  themselves or their families along rte. 601.  There is a large
  trailer park along US 11 but behind Fisher's Hill, where it is
  not particularly intrusive.  Several new homes have been built at
  the base of Flint Hill and in the vicinity of the intersection of
  rtes. 639 and 757, degrading the ability to interpret the
  battle's initial phases.  There is a short strip of modern
  housing along rte. 757 south of Fisher's Hill.  Based on
  interviews with several local landowners, there was general
  approval of the recent APCWS acquisition and a strong consensus
  that new development in the area should be excluded.  The major
  visual intrusion in the battlefield is I-81, which prompted the
  field surveyor to lower the integrity rating from good to fair. 
  Any future move to widen I-81 or to provide an interchange would
  severely impact the battlefield's integrity.
