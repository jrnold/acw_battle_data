near-constant skirmishing between the towns of Hollywood and
Okolona and between Okolona and the Little Missouri River.
The ABPP shifted the Core Area at Okolona to the east so as to
include the Old Military Road. The Core Area at the Little Missouri

Update to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation’s Civil War Battlefields
Final DRAFT -- State of Arkansas

Condition Statement

Elkin’s Ferry is among the most pristine Civil War battlefields in
Arkansas. This rural area has seen only slight changes in land use
since the Civil War. Like other battlefields associated with the
Camden Expedition of 1864, it offers a tremendous opportunity for
preservation and interpretation of the entire historic landscape.

Union victory

Study Area

7,600.04 acres
The ABPP added several Confederate approach routes to the Study
Area. The main Confederate push came from the northwest, but
there were a number of smaller advances from the north,
southwest, and south upon the fortified city of Helena. The historic
trace of the Mississippi River was also added to the Study Area due
to the presence of the USS Tyler at the battle.
The Core Area was expanded slightly into the Mississippi River to
include the multiple firing positions of the Tyler.

Condition Statement

Due to the urban nature of this battlefield’s setting; much of the
historic landscape has been altered and fragmented. Numerous
character-defining features survive, however, particularly portions
of the Federal ring of fortifications around the city and the
northern and southern portions of the Core Area. The
Confederate approach routes from the north retain integrity
within the St. Francis National Forest. Preservation efforts should
focus on ensuring that surviving features are permanently
protected.

Study Area

3,528.55 acres
The ABPP ecxtended the Study Area to include the roads over which
Federal forces moved prior to the Confederate ambush: the Cotton
Plant Road from James Ferry to the Bayou De View Bridge
(southeast of the town of Cotton Plant) and the Old DesArc Road.
The Study Area was reduced around the Hill Plantation and the
Cotton Plant and Old DesArc intersection.
The Core Area along the Old DesArc Road was reduced in size to
more accurately reflect the area of fighting. The ABPP added a
second small Core Area to represent the important skirmish at
Bayou De View Bridge that saved the bridge from being burned and
allowed Federal forces to press on the following day.

Union victory in retreat

Study Area

7,796.37 acres
The 1993 Study Area boundary was a generic polygon that did not
accurately reflect the extent of the historic battlefield. The ABPP
revised the Study Area to more accurately reflect troop movements,
areas of fighting, and historic road alignments. The route from the
south was used by both Federal and Confederate forces to approach
the combat area. The route to the north is the Federal route of
withdrawal across the Saline River and onto high ground (the
Confederates did not cross the river).
The 1993 Core Area was realigned along the historic roadbed and
widened to include lines of battle and to reflect more accurately the
scope of the fighting. Land north of the Saline River was removed
from the Core Area because no fighting has been documented on
that side of the river.

Condition Statement

Around the town of Leola, the battlefield has been altered due to
development. North of Leola, the critical engagement area
remains undeveloped, but is used primarily for the commercial
production of bottomland hardwood. Timbering activities and
unscientific collection of artifacts have resulted in significant
disturbance to the archeological and topographic character of the
battlefield. The Jenkins’ Ferry State Park protects approximately
30 acres of the northern portion of the Core Area. Future
landscape and archeological surveys are needed to help inform
forest management planning and harvesting techniques that will
minimize additional damage to the historic landscape.

Results

Confederate victory

Study Area

16,534.56 acres
The 1993 Study Area boundary was a generic polygon that, while
encompassing the battle, did not accurately reflect the battlefield.
The ABPP significantly reduced the Study Area to more accurately
reflect troop movements, areas of fighting, and historic road
alignments. The ABPP has redrawn the Study Area to more
accurately reflect BG Joseph O. Shelby's approach to the battlefield
from the north and east, other approach and withdrawal routes,
and troop movements.
The 1993 Core Area was reshaped to more accurately reflect areas
of fighting. In addition, two other Core Areas were added to the
Study Area. The small easternmost Core Area represents the 1st
Missouri Cavalry Battalion's capture of the Union-held Saline River
crossing at Mount Elba. The westernmost Core Area represents the
fight at Moro Creek between the 1st Iowa Cavalry and Hunter's
Missouri Cavalry Regiment. The Confederates failed in their
attempt to capture the Federal horsemen at Moro Creek.

Condition Statement

While portions of the battlefield have been altered, most of the
historic landscape retains good integrity. The Marks’ Mills State
Park protects very little of the battlefield. Significant land
protection efforts are needed to preserve historic lands beyond the
state park. The primary land use within the battlefield is
commercial forestry. Timbering activities have resulted in
significant disturbance to the archeological and topographic
character of the battlefield. Future landscape and archeological
surveys are needed to help inform forest management planning
and harvesting techniques that will minimize additional damage to
the historic landscape.

The 1993 Study Area was modified to reflect the position of the
Mississippi River circa 1864, the correct location of Sunnyside
Landing (the Federal point of debarkation and encampment), troop
movements, and avenues of approach and withdrawal. The Core
Area was narrowed slightly to better represent the positions of the
opposing battle lines.
