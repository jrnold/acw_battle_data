Union victory

Study Area

4,656.82 acres
The ABPP made minor changes to the 1993 Study Area. These
include 1) adjusting the Federal and Confederate approach routes
from the north on their historic alignments and lengthening these
roads slightly to reflect the armies’ documented start and end
points near Battlecreek Road; and 2) adding the Confederate
retreat route to the south along which the weakened Confederates
(Hood had ordered half of Hardee’s force to Atlanta the previous
night) hastily withdrew under the assumed threat of Federal
pursuit. In addition, both the Study Area and the Core Area were
expanded to the north to take in lands associated with fighting on
September 1, 1864.

Final DRAFT -- State of Georgia

Condition Statement

Residential and commercial development associated with the
growth of Jonesboro has engulfed the battlefield; only isolated
historic houses and small fragments of the historic landscape
remain. Opportunities exist for commemoration and
interpretation, but no meaningful landscape preservation is

Mountain National Battlefield Park. The park protects most of
Kennesaw Mountain (the region’s dominate landform), and the
Union and Confederate field works and artillery positions on the
mountain. The rapid pace of land development in Cobb County
during the past 17 years has left little historic land undisturbed
outside of the park boundary. Residential subdivisions have
hemmed in the park land and obliterated most of the unprotected
battlefield landscape. In addition, the density of development
around Marietta has produced significant pollution. Poor air
quality diminishes the views at the battlefield and inhibits battle
interpretation.

The ABPP expanded the 1993 Study Area and the Core Area on the

to take in the XXIII Corps’ line of battle. The Core Area now
includes all the artillery positions along the Federal line of battle
and several batteries located behind the XXIII Corps’ position.

Condition Statement

Much of the battlefield landscape has been altered and
fragmented. Some essential features remain, however, including
the Kolb farm house and family cemetery, Ward Creek, and the
heights used by the Federal XX and XXIII Corps in their repulse of
the Confederate assault. These resources are protected within the
Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. Residential
subdivisions have hemmed in the park land and overwhelmed the
battlefield landscape beyond the park boundary, including the
heights from which the Confederates began their assault. Little
opportunity for additional land protection exists at the Kolb’s Farm
battlefield.

Campaign

Battle Date(s)

Principal Commanders

Results

Confederate victory

Study Area

3,880.28 acres
The ABPP completely redrew the 1993 boundaries for Lovejoy’s
Station. The new Study Area gives a more complete picture of the
Federal approach from the northeast toward Lovejoy’s Station, and
the Confederate response along the Macon & Western Railroad.
The Study Area was expanded to the east to include the fighting at
Nash Farm and the rearguard action at Walnut Creek. The Core
Areas for both of those engagements were delineated based on
recent archeological studies.

Condition Statement

Much of the battlefield landscape has been altered, leaving some
essential battle features: the Jonesboro and McDonough Roads,
the Macon & Western Railroad line (now the Central of Georgia)
running along its historic alignment, the Nash Farm house, rolling
fields just west and east of the house, Confederate earthworks,
and the crossing at Walnut Creek. Development pressure
continues to build. To date, residential and commercial
development has destroyed most of the earthworks associated
with the battle in Clayton County. The four-lane US Route 19/41
also cuts through portions of the battlefield. Expansion of a local
water treatment plant which uses wetlands for filtration,
represents an immediate threat to the few original earthworks left
on the battlefield.

Study Area

60,906.60 acres
The ABPP’s boundaries for Marietta reflect a complex series of
military operations and engagements over a month-long period in
1864. The ABPP significantly revised the 1993 boundaries to reflect,
to the extent practicable, the course of 30 days of tenacious
fighting, maneuvering, and entrenching as Sherman’s army group
sought a way through or around the Army of Tennessee.

Condition Statement

The battlefields that represent the military operations around
Marietta have been devastated by sprawling development.
Mountains and heights used by both armies are now dotted with
communications towers. Hillsides and valleys are covered by
modern land development. Because the Study Area involved in
these operations is so vast, however, some opportunities still exist
to preserve small portions of the battlefields. Remnants of
Confederate and Federal earthworks survive, in particular on Lost
Mountain, Pine Mountain, and Brushy Mountain, at Gilgal Church,
and on both the Mud Creek Line and the Johnston River Line.
State and local entities should target these and other surviving
resources for protection and management before the last
remaining vestiges of the Marietta Operations are lost.

action at New Hope Church. The Study Area was likewise expanded
