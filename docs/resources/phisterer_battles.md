**path**: data/phisterer_battles.csv

Data from Phisterer, Frederick (1883) *Statistical Records of the Armies of the United States* ([Google books](http://books.google.com/books?id=cVNHr_nnLlYC)).

Data on major battles along with Union and Confederate casualties from the table "Loss in engagements, etc., where the total was five hundred or more on the side of the Union troops--(149)." on p. 213-219. The caption for the table reads:

   Although the losses here given are generally based on official medical returns, the figures must not be taken
   as perfectly reliable, for in many instances the returns were based on estimates, and the totals of losses were,
   by *later* and more reliable returns, sometimes considerably reduced. Confederate losses are generally based on estimates.

Some notes on specific battles

- 2345: includes several battles and overlaps with 2354. 
- 2351, 2355, 2366, 2373 all refer to Trenches in front of Petersburg,
  but don't seem to point to any specific battles. Most of the battles
  in the Petersburg Campaign have their own entries. See
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg
- 2307: Refers to all of
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streight%27s_Raid, but there is only
  one battle.
- 2362: This is NOT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman%27s_Raid.  There appears to be no battle page for this, 
  although it is discussed in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stoneman.
- 2372: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_campaign.  Linked to all
  battles in
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Battles_of_the_Atlanta_Campaign_of_the_American_Civil_War. This battle 
  overlaps with several others.
- 2376: Price's invasion of Missouri; includes a number of engagements http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%27s_Raid.  This battle is linked to all battles in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Battles_of_Price%27s_Missouri_Expedition_of_the_American_Civil_War
- 2280: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_Battles. Matched to the Seven Day's Battles except Oak Grove, 
  which has its own entry (2279).
- 2395 would appear to refer to Battle_of_Fort_Stedman, but 2394 explicitly refers to Fort Stedman. So 
  I cannot match this entry to a specific battle.
- 2397: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_raid
